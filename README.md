## Symmetric 17px Command Block

Perhaps you haven't noticed it before, but due to the vanilla Minecraft block textures being 16px, the texture for the command block isnâ€™t completely symmetric or perfect!

Once you spot this issue, you'll find it hard to look at command blocks with your old, naÃ¯ve eyes again ðŸ˜­

To solve this problem, I created a dedicated **17px** texture for the command block. It looks perfectly flawless, symmetric, and complete!
